# Mario Pest Control Website
<p>
This project is a bout the three pests in Mario. The website has GUI that allows that user to select the number of each pest caught and with the default coins per pest, the total number of coins can be
automatically calculated. The overall total is also calculated automatically and displayed at the top left corner of the screen.
HTML and CSS were used for the general appearance of the website and Javascript was used to do all the calculations behind.
